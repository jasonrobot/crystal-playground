;;; Commentary:

;; This is port of github.com/grafov/rust-playground for Crystal
;; language.  You can spin up a temporary project to play around with
;; some Crystal code.  It uses 'crystal new app', so the playground can
;; have external deps added in the shard.yml, and it has a git repo
;; initialized, so it isn't too hard to copy a playground into a
;; standalone app.
